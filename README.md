CMBS(Customer Management & Billing System)
==========================================
Customer Management & Billing System(CMBS), a CRM of sorts but more focus on just handling customer details and the service plans they have subscribed to. The app itself is not yet a finished product that you would use in you typical day to day business operation, but we are here to show you that the browser has indeed the desktop, and a powerful one as a matter of fact.

*Disclosure: We are actually developing a Billing System for one of our clients and what is talked about here makes part of that solution or used in prototyping*

**Features include...**
* A complete listing of all the client records
* Record filtering and sorting *based on any of the enabled filter/sort fields*
* Export to CSV *for use in your popular spreadsheet, whether LibreOffice Calc or MS Excel*
* Import of records from a CSV file
* Add and Edit forms
* Input data validation
* Persistent store to NoSQL backend of your choice. Currently, browser localstore is used but there is nothing stopping any to use whatever backend. We will be adding IndexedDB and levelDB
